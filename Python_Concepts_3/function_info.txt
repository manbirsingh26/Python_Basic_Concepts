Function is a user-defined or built-in code which works only when it is called.

It is used to increase reusability of code and to reduce the errors in the program.
It also makes code manageable and organized.
e.g:- print(), range(), random(), etc.

Functions are of two types:-
1. user defined
2. built - in functions

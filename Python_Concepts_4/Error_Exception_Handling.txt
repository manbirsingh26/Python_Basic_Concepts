When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, program will normally stop and generate an error message.
Errors are mostly caused by wrong syntax.
Exceptions are logic-based wherein syntax is right but logic is not right.
These errors/exceptions are of following types:-
1. Syntax Error
2. NameError
3. ZeroDivisionError
4. TypeError
5. File not found
6. IndentationError
7. ArithmeticError
8. AttributeError
9. ConnectionError
10. Exception (This is the most common which is used as it covers mostly all the errors)

These exceptions can be handled using the following blocks:-
1.The 'try' block lets you test a block of code for errors.

2. The 'except' block lets you handle the error.

3. The 'else' block lets you execute code when there is no error.

4. The 'finally' block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.
It is useful when we want to de-allocate/clean up resources such as closing a file or db connection.

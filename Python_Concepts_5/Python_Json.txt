JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.

JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.

Python has a built-in package called json, which can be used to work with JSON data.

You can convert Python objects of the following types, into JSON strings:
dict
list
tuple
string
int
float
True
False
None

When you convert from Python to JSON, Python objects are converted into the JSON (JavaScript) equivalent:

Python	JSON
dict	Object
list	Array
tuple	Array
str	    String
int	    Number
float	Number
True	true
False	false
None	null

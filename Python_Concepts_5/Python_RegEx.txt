A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.

RegEx Functions:-
The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match:

Function	Description
findall	    Returns a list containing all matches
search	    Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
split	    Returns a list where the string has been split at each match
sub	        Replaces one or many matches with a string

Metacharacters:-
Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:

Character	Description	                                                                Example
[]	        A set of characters	                                                        "[a-m]"
\	        Signals a special sequence (can also be used to escape special characters)	"\d"
.	        Any character (except newline character)	                                "he..o"
^	        Starts with	                                                                "^hello"
$	        Ends with	                                                                "planet$"
*	        Zero or more occurrences	                                                "he.*o"
+	        One or more occurrences	                                                    "he.+o"
?	        Zero or one occurrence	                                                    "he.?o"
{}	        Exactly the specified number of occurrences	                                "he.{2}o"
|	        Either or	                                                                "falls|stays"
()	        Capture and group

Special Sequences:-
A special sequence is a \ followed by one of the characters in the list below, and has a special meaning:


\A -> Returns a match if the specified characters are at the beginning of the string 	e.g."\AThe"
\b -> Returns a match where the specified characters are at the beginning or at the end of a word e.g.r"\bain"
(the "r" in the beginning is making sure that the string is being treated as a "raw string") e.g. r"ain\b"


\B -> Returns a match where the specified characters are present, but NOT at the beginning (or at the end) of a word
(the "r" in the beginning is making sure that the string is being treated as a "raw string") e.g. r"\Bain",
r"ain\B"


\d -> Returns a match where the string contains digits (numbers from 0-9) e.g. "\d"
\D -> Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain digits e.g. "\D"
\s -> Returns a match where the string contains a white space character e.g. "\s"
\S -> Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain a white space character e.g. "\S"
\w -> Returns a match where the string contains any word characters
 (characters from a to Z, digits from 0-9, and the underscore _ character) 	e.g. "\w"
\W -> Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain any word characters e.g. "\W"
\Z -> Returns a match if the specified characters are at the end of the string  e.g. "Spain\Z"
